# Password Creator 
This program allows the user to either create a password, or have one generated for the user using randomisation and string manipulation. The initial menu that appears will provide the user with three options: Password Creator, Password Generator and Exit.

### Password Creator (Option 1)
This option allows the user to enter in their own, created password. The program will only accept a password that provides it with certain parameters. These parameters being: 

- Password's length must be at least 8 characters long
- Password must include a number
- Password must include a letter
- Password must include a capital letter

If the user input dos not follow these rules, then the password is not accepted. 

### Password Generator (option 2) 
This option allows the user to have the program create a secure password for them. The password that is generated will automatically include the parameters of a secure password outlined in the Password Creator.

### Exit

This option, when clicked, closes the menu and terminates the program.
